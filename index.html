  <h3>Often, we moved to different places. It was just my parents, my big brother, and me. For
me, the hardest part about all this moving, I always had to make new friends every time. I mean, yeah, I’m fifteen and I try to be in sports, but it’s still hard. I don’t quite remember everywhere we’ve lived. There was one town we lived in that I can remember as if it were yesterday… Let’s just say, I’ll never look at clowns the same again.

Now, before I start, I probably should tell you… I’m actually an orphan. After my
parents’ death, my aunt and uncle adopted me, making my cousin more of like my
brother. Those are the people I’m in the car with now.</h3>
  <h3>The first night at that house, after I did my business, I went to my room and got in bed after turning on the radio to my favorite station. I shut off the light and closed my eyes… But I just couldn’t shake the feeling that someone was watching me. So I sat up and looked around… There was nothing I could see. I just laid back down and closed my eyes.</h3>
</div>
<div id="section2" class="container-fluid">
<h3>Suddenly, I heard something in the darkness of my room… What is that? Scratching? I got out of bed, in curiosity to find the source. It sounded as if it were coming from the closet… I looked at it and the door itself was still, that I could see. Though there was an eerie, red light illuminating from under the door. I noticed that the scratching grew louder and the knob to the closet door began to jiggle as if someone were trying to open it, but couldn’t. Out of my stupid actions and curiosity, I went to the closet and grabbed the knob. Everything suddenly stopped. I went ahead and grabbed the flashlight I kept near the head of my bed. I flipped it on and turned the knob. Then the door burst open and
blew me back at the wall.</h3>
<h3>I popped up from my bed, gasping for air and breathing heavily. I put my hand on my head, ‘Phew, it was just a dream,’ I thought. Then I heard the sound of crackling bones. I froze and looked over toward the closet, I saw a silhouette, just standing there and staring at me. It’s eyes were like matches, and they seemed as if they were trying to look into my soul. I was so scared I literally couldn’t move. Soon, I built up the courage to grab the flashlight and turn it on. The figure was gone.</h3>

<div id="section3" class="container-fluid">
<h3>I realized that there is a tapping outside my window. I decided to go check it out. I peeked through the blinds and saw the branch next to my window. ‘That’s what was making that tapping noise,’ I thought. I exhaled and turned. Then I looked up and screamed at the top of my lungs. There was a silhouette in the doorway. “Honey, are you okay?” A familiar voice said. The figure turned on the light, it was my mom. “I’m fine, Mom. It was just a nightmare.” She walked to me and put her hand on my forehead. “You’re burning up. Lie down and get some rest. You have school tomorrow.” She said and led me to my bed.</h3>
<h3>The next few nights were the exact same. Creeks, scratches, the trembling of the closet doorknob, and seeing silhouettes. It got to the point that I told my parents about it. They told me to not worry, that it’s probably just my mind playing games with me. I thought then that yeah, it probably was. We were completely wrong.</h3>

  </div>
<div id="section41" class="container-fluid">
<h3>A couple nights later, the noises began again. I decided to just try to get back to sleep. But there was something different tonight… whispering. That never happened before. I sat up and the whispering stopped. But instead of just lying back down, I decided to get up and check it out. I stood there motionless as I felt warm breath on the back of my neck. I was paralyzed in fear. When I got the courage to turn, I saw a dark figure and I flew back. The moonlight shining through the window had shown me a face that resembled that of a clown. Except the face had blood smeared all over it. It jumped at me and I guarded my eyes. I didn’t want to see that horrible, gruesome face before I died. But nothing happened. I saw it jump at me. I uncovered my face and looked around.</h3>
